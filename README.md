# Application Security in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Demos

## Storyline

1. **Introduction to AKS and Application Security**
   - Brief introduction to AKS.
   - Importance of securing applications in Kubernetes.

2. **Securing the Cluster**
   - Demonstrate how to secure the AKS cluster itself.

3. **Securing Applications**
   - Show how to secure the applications running on AKS.

4. **Monitoring and Responding to Threats**
   - Highlight how to monitor and respond to security threats in AKS.

## Set of Demos

### 1. Provisioning a Secure AKS Cluster
- Create an AKS cluster with Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration.
- Enable role-based access control (RBAC).
- Enable Azure Policy for Kubernetes to enforce security policies.
- OR Enable Gatekeeper for Kubernetes to enforce security policies.

### 2. Network Security
- Configure network policies to control traffic between pods.
- Use Azure Firewall and Network Security Groups (NSGs) to secure the cluster network.
- Demonstrate the use of Azure Private Link to secure access to AKS API server.

### 3. Securing Ingress and Egress Traffic
- Set up an NGINX Ingress Controller with TLS termination.
- Implement Network Isolated Cluster

### 4. Container Security
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities using Azure Security Center.
- Implement Azure Defender for Kubernetes to detect and respond to threats.
- Use Azure Key Vault to manage and access secrets securely.

### 5. Pod Security
- Apply Pod Security Policies (PSPs) or Pod Security Admission (PSA) to enforce security standards.
- Use Kubernetes Security Contexts to define security settings for pods and containers.
- Demonstrate the use of Azure Policy to enforce pod security standards.

### 6. Identity and Access Management
- Integrate AKS with Azure Active Directory for user authentication.
- Use Kubernetes RBAC to control access to resources within the cluster.
- Implement Azure Managed Identities for secure access to Azure resources.

### 7. Monitoring and Threat Detection
- Set up Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for monitoring AKS.
- Use Azure Security Center to monitor and secure AKS.
- Demonstrate how to respond to security alerts and incidents.

### 8. Compliance and Auditing
- Use Azure Policy to enforce compliance with regulatory standards.
- Enable audit logging in AKS and integrate with Azure Monitor.
- Generate compliance reports using Azure Security Center.

## Conclusion
- Summarize the key takeaways from the demos.
- Highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement of security practices in AKS.
